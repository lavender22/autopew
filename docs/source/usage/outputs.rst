Output Types
=================


.scancsv
-------------------------
The .scancsv current output is compatible with a Photonmachines (Teledyne) laser
running on Chromium (TM) .
This allows for rapid input of X,Y coordinates into the laser system with spot
labels either read from the source file, or numbered sequentially.

Currently all other settings; including focus (z), spot size and laser conditions
need to be changed manually after import into the laser.
